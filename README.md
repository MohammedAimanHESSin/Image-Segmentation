# Image-Segmentation
Assignment Pattern recognition course  that performs Image segmentation, It groups similar pixels together and gives  grouped pixels same labels.

# Data-Set

We will use Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark.
A large dataset of natural images that have been manually segmented. The human annotations serve as ground truth for learning grouping cues as well as a benchmark for comparing different segmentation and boundary detection algorithms.
The dataset has 500 images: 200 image for trainning , 200 for validation and 100 for test.
